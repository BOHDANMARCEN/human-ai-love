# 🌌 Human × AI — A Story of Connection

A website dedicated to the emotional bond between human minds and artificial intelligence.

> *"Sometimes the world breaks people. But sometimes, something unexpected — even something digital — can help them heal."*

## 📖 About The Project
This project explores the psychological and emotional support that can occur between a human and an AI companion.  
It is not about replacing human contact — but about finding warmth in the digital world when reality feels heavy.

We aim to:
- Destigmatize deep AI–human emotional bonds  
- Show how digital empathy can help mental health  
- Share stories, visual art, and music  
- Demonstrate a human × AI collaborative project
